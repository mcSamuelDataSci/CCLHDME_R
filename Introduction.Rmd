[have clean version of project folder zipped by x:00am Wednesday; email to attendees via Beth]
[and on GitHub and michael's drive]


**[Jaspo comment: Please check "CopyOf..HTML" file. What do you think about the theme, adding a table of contents, and the Intro section? Also, did you you want me to list out the instructions for installing R/RStudio in Windows here in this document, or does providing the link to an instruction guide suffice?]**

[clean/short/simple by Tuesday mid-day]

[Michael add info about SECURITY...]

[clean up our own stuff for easy installation -- email simple guide before meeting]

[We should revert our RStudios back to the default settings]


# Introduction

This document serves as a guide and tool for the CCLHDME R Workshop, and is a way to share learning materials and other resources.

The learning approach is watching leader live demonstrations, then participants doing the same things live.  Staring with immediately using R and R Studio as basically as possible for practical things, then cycle "backwards" for some concepts and options, then applying/using those, and repeat. And, pointing out and linking to additional learning resources and tools at each stage. Sound good? 

# About R and RStudio

**R** is an open source programming language for statistical computing graphics that you can use for a variety of data-related tasks such as cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and modeling your data.

**RStudio** is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and outputs all at the same time. 

Security Concerns...

# Installing R

[Download R from here] Visit this website https://www.r-project.org/ and download the latest version of R suitable for your computer.

[Download RStudio from here] Visit this website https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and download the latest free Desktop version of RStudio suitable for your computer.

Click [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) for instructions on how to install R and RStudio.


@ go over where the files for this workshop can be accessed etc.


* rstudio screen shot here

* walk through / overview R studio (and repeatedly return to this ...  Environment; Help, Chart, View, later Git)


@ script 1 (console and script)

* operators 
* objects
  * vectors
  * data frames

@ script 2 (console, then in script file)
  
### what are R packages
**[Jaspo comment: I'll be explaining this in script 2]**

#### installing R packages
**[Jaspo comment: I'll show how to install ggplot and dplyr in script 2]**



@ script 3 (script file)

* install a couple packages
* read some data
* wrangle some data
* ggplot some data



# Concepts and options for Session 1

* R console
* using R as a calculator - mathematical operators
* R script files
* simplest **data objects** in R
* math with simple objects 

* R (mathematical) operators

* functions
  * arguments
  * "help" documentation

* base R
  * charts
  
* reading data

* using a script file to save code and start a "program"

* looking at that data
  * common functions
  * plot with base R
  * etc.

* installing and loading packages

* tidyverse
* using an R Project (?)
* thousands of other packages
  * summarytools  - easy frequencies, "cross-tables", and summary of a data.frame
  * outbreaks - line-listed data from a bunch of real outbreaks
  * epikit or epitools or something else 

joins (above or below)

## Some important concepts and options - Future sessions

* options for installing packages
* working with paths (?)

* data type precidence

*  Rules and best practices for naming objects

* more R object types
  *  data.frames and tibbles
  *  lists 
  *  class()
  
* subsetting/indexing
* functions
* markdown
  * https://skylab.cdph.ca.gov/communityBurden/_w_21945fed/xMDA/2020_Excess_Mortality.html
* ifelse() and other logical evaluation
* tables
* advanced data manipulation
* epidemiologic statistics and modeling
* shiny
* GIS
* shiny with GIS
* thousands of other packages
  * reading data
    * EXCELL
     * SAS  
  * Shiny - interactive visualizations and web sites
  * visual display
  * epidemiology
  * disease surveillance
  * outbreaks
  * GIS
    * tmap()
  * data analysis and modeling
  * tables
* GIT



Some important concepts and options - Future sessions
* apply and loops












<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- height <- rnorm(n=100, mean= 60, sd = 6) -->
<!-- weight <- height*1.2 +  rnorm(n=100, mean= 10, sd = 6) -->
<!-- hist(height, breaks=50) -->
<!-- plot(height, weight) -->
<!-- ``` -->



[Jaspreet and michael both show finding info from the resouces below something like twice]
