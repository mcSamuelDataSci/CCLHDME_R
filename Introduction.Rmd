# Introduction

This document serves as a very general guide and tool for the CCLHDME R Workshop, and is a way to share learning materials and other resources.

The learning approach is live demonstrations, with participants then doing the same steps live, as possible.  Staring with immediately using R and R Studio in the most basic ways for practical things, then cyclying "backwards" for some concepts and options, then applying/using those, and repeat. And, pointing out and linking to additional learning resources and tools at each stage. Sound good? 

# About R and RStudio

**R** is an open source programming language for statistical computing graphics that you can use for a variety of data-related tasks such as cleaning, analyzing, visualizing, and modeling your data.

**RStudio** is a free, open source IDE (integrated development environment) for R. Its interface is organized so that the user can clearly view graphs, data tables, R code, and outputs all at the same time. 

# Since R is open source is it safe to use? What about our IT department's concerns?

* all software has security issues
* the teams that oversee R (CRAN and RStudio) both review and test everything before it goes public and have large incentives for security
  * R and R Package Security [FAQ](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042593974-R-and-R-Package-Security) for users or admins 
* May consider only intalling "official" packages from "CRAN" rather than other "local" locations like on GitHub
* At CDPH R and R Studio are approved, available, and widely used with both the "free" desktop versions and the enterprise, server-based version

  * summarytools  - easy frequencies, "cross-tables", and summary of a data.frame
  * outbreaks - line-listed data from a bunch of real outbreaks
  * epikit or epitools or something else
